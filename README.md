# NNP-CuZrO
An implementation of neural network potentials (NNPs) capable of simulating the mechanical/physical behavior of oxidized CuZr (e.g., CuZr(O)) metallic glasses.
## How to use
The potential files for Cu-Zr-O tenary are available. They can be run in Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) (https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/) linked with the aenet packages (https://github.com/atomisticnet/aenet/).
